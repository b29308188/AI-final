1.How does it works?(40 secs)
(1)Introduce our game and the game rules
(2)Introduce the different agents
- sample agents : gather, migrate
— heuristics :  robber, gather-migrate
- agents with utility function: greedy  
  1 games:
robber v.s. gather-migrate

*(3)Compare them


2.What is the greatest challenge and how do we solve it?(30secs)
(1) approximate continuous spatial data with discrete information
  -- define the search space by only consider which marker to move
     and the position to move the marker to

(2) few previous works and this is a two-agent game. It’s hard to evaluate our work.
  — compare agents with the two sample agents/ watch pervious videos
